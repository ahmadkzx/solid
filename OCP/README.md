# O (OCP)
## Open/Closed Principle

entities should open for extension but closed for modification.  
it tells you to write your code so that you will be able to add new functionality without changing the existing code.  

actually this principle prevents changing the behavior of entities that can be dependency of other entities and make bugs.
