# S (SRP)
## Single Responsibility Principle

all of entities should have on responsibility and encapsulate that part.
for example, the User class should have only responsibility over user stuff and should not have any other responsibility like printing text.

Single Responsibility Principle benefit is making your software easier to implement and preventing unexpected side-effects of future changes.
